Welcome to the Asteroid Wars project.

This project helps remedy burnout. The result of burnout is people become less motivated and less efficient in the long run.

This project intends to create a way for people to take their minds off their work with an interesting and fun game. The idea is that they will be more effective at their work when they return from a break.

Burnout happens to many people, not just in the software industry.

This project will use HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, localStorage, Bootstrap, JSON, and AJAX. The Acapella API will be used to translate String quotes to audio of Yoda's voice.
