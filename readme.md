# Welcome to the Asteroid Wars project.

## PURPOSE
This project aims to remedy burnout. Burnout happens to many people, but particularly in the software industry. The result of burnout is people become less motivated and less efficient in the long run.

This project intends to create a way for people to take their minds off their work with an interesting and fun game. The idea is that people will be more effective at their work when they return from a break.

This project will use HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, localStorage, Bootstrap, JSON, and AJAX. The Acapella API will be used to translate String quotes to audio of Yoda's voice.

##  START

  - make an in depth styling plan
  - take breaks more consistently to help prevent mental fatigue
  - think ahead when building features into the site
  - keep code clean as I go - fix issues when theyâ€™re found rather than when I have to make a feature work
  - analyze api/framework code for things I don't fully understand and ask for help


##   STOP
  - stop jumping into styling without a plan
  - working too late
  - working for longer than an hour at a time



##  CONTINUE
  - using pivotal tracker
  - breaking work down into manageable chunks
  - getting feedback from people as work progresses
  - clean up comments and extra files as you
